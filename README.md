# About

A collection of tools Standard Ebooks uses to produce its ebooks, including basic setup of ebooks, text processing, and build tools.

# Warning for Mac users

macOS support is currently **experimental**. Proceed at your own risk. See below for prerequisites and installation instructions.

For a smoother experience, you may want to run the tools on your Mac through a linux virtual machine or container.

# Installation

Several dependencies must be installed before you can use these tools. 

## Linux

On Ubuntu 16.04, you can install everything with:

	sudo apt install python3-pip xsltproc libxml2-utils xmlstarlet libxml-xpath-perl recode html-xml-utils librsvg2-bin libimage-exiftool-perl zip epubcheck calibre default-jre
	sudo pip3 install pyhyphen roman titlecase beautifulsoup4 smartypants pillow gitpython cssselect regex lxml

	# Install hyphenation dictionaries for the pyhyphen library
	sudo python3 -c "exec(\"from hyphen import dictools\\ndictools.install('en_GB')\\ndictools.install('en_US')\")"

	# Install required fonts

# Tool descriptions

-	### `british2american`

	Try to convert British quote style to American quote style in DIRECTORY/src/epub/text/.

-	### `build-cover`

	Build an ebook cover a Standard Ebook source directory and place the output in DIRECTORY/src/epub/images/.

	Convert files in a Standard Ebooks source directory to be Kobo-compatible.

-	### `endnotes2kindle`

	Convert epub-friendly endnotes to Kindle-friendly popup endnotes.

-	### `find-unused-selectors`

	Find unused local.css CSS selectors in Standard Ebook source directories.

-	### `hyphenate`

-	### `ordinal`

	Print the ordinal for one or more integers.

-	### `prepare-release`

	Calculate the ebook's word count, and update content.opf and colophon.xhtml with release and modified timestamps.

# What a Standard Ebooks source directory looks like

Many of these tools act on Standard Ebooks source directories.  Such directories have a consistent minimal structure:

	.
	|-images/
	|--cover.jpg
	|--cover.source.jpg
	|--cover.svg
	|--titlepage.svg
	|-src/
	|--epub/
	|---css/
	|----core.css
	|----local.css
	|---images/
	|----cover.svg
	|----titlepage.svg
	|---text/
	|---content.opf
	|---onix.xml
	|---toc.xhtml
	|--META-INF/
	|---container.xml
	|--mimetype

`./images/` contains source images for the cover and titlepages, as well as ebook-specific source images.  Source images should be in their maximum available resolution, then compressed and placed in `./src/epub/images/` for distribution.

`./src/epub/` contains the actual epub files.
