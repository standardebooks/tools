# About

A collection of tools Standard Ebooks uses to produce its ebooks, including basic setup of ebooks, text processing, and build tools.

Installing this toolset using `pipx` makes the `se` command line executable available. Its various commands are described below, or you can use `se help` to list them.

# Installation

The toolset requires Python >= 3.5.

To install the toolset locally for development and debugging, see [Installation for Developers](#installation-for-developers).

```

## macOS users (up to macOS 10.14)

These instructions were tested on macOS 10.12 to 10.14.

**Warning:** The Standard Ebooks toolset currently will *not* build cover images on macOS 10.15 Catalina due to Inkscape compatibility problems. The older version of Inkscape that works with this project is 32-bit only and no longer runs on 10.15, and the new version [doesn’t yet have a command line interface](https://gitlab.com/inkscape/inkscape/issues/457). For the time being, your best option is to run Ubuntu or Fedora (see above) in a virtual machine, for example with [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/).

1. Install the [Homebrew package manager](https://brew.sh). Or, if you already have it installed, make sure it’s up to date:

	```shell
	brew update
	```

2. Install dependencies:

	```shell
	# Install some pre-flight dependencies.
	brew install python imagemagick libmagic librsvg exiftool git
	pip3 install pyopenssl

	# Install pipx.
	python3 -m pip install pipx
	python3 -m pipx ensurepath

	# Install required applications.
	brew cask install java calibre xquartz inkscape

	# Install the toolset.
	pipx install standardebooks

	# Install required fonts.
	cp $HOME/.local/pipx/venvs/standardebooks/lib/python3.*/site-packages/se/data/fonts/*/*.otf ~/Library/Fonts/
	```
## OpenBSD 6.6 Users

These instructions were tested on OpenBSD 6.6, but may also work on the 6.5 release as well.

1. Create a text file to feed into ```pkg_add``` called "~/standard-ebooks-packages". It should contain the following:

	```shell
	py3-pip--
	py3-virtualenv--
	libxml--
	librsvg--
	p5-Image-ExifTool--
	ImageMagick--
	jdk--%11
	inkscape--
	calibre--
	git--
	vim--
	```
Optionally, replace `vim--` with `vim--gtk3` to include gvim for its Unicode editing features.

2. Install dependencies using ```doas pkg_add -ivl ~/standard-ebooks-packages```. Follow linking instructions provided by ```pkg_add``` to save keystrokes, unless you want to have multiple python versions and pip versions. In my case, I ran ```doas ln -sf /usr/local/bin/pip3.7 /usr/local/bin/pip```.

3. Add ```~/.local/bin``` to your path.

4. Run ```pip install --user pipx```

5. If you're using ```ksh``` from base and have already added ```~/.local/bin```, you can skip ```pipx ensurepath``` because this step is for ```bash``` users.

6. The rest of the process is similar to that used on other platforms:

	```shell
	# Install the toolset.
	pipx install standardebooks

	# Install required fonts.
	mkdir -p $HOME/.local/share/fonts/
	cp $HOME/.local/pipx/venvs/standardebooks/lib/python3.*/site-packages/se/data/fonts/*/*.otf $HOME/.local/share/fonts/

	# Refresh the local font cache.
	doas fc-cache -f
	```

## Installation for developers

If you want to work on the toolset source, it’s helpful to tell `pipx` to install the package in “editable” mode. This will allow you to edit the source of the package live and see changes immediately, without having to uninstall and re-install the package.

To do that, follow the general installation instructions above; but instead of doing `pipx install standardebooks`, do the following:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/standardebooks/tools.git
pipx install --editable tools

# Optional: ZSH users can install tab completion.
sudo ln -s $(readlink -f .)/tools/se/completions/zsh/_se /usr/share/zsh/vendor-completions/_se && hash -rf && compinit

# Optional: Bash users can install tab completion.
sudo ln -s $(readlink -f .)/tools/se/completions/bash/se /usr/share/bash-completion/completions/se
```

Now the `se` binary is in your path, and any edits you make to source files in the `tools/` directory are immediately reflected when executing the binary.

### Linting with `pylint`

Before we can use `pylint` on the toolset source, we have to inject `pylint` into the venv `pipx` created for the `standardebooks` package:

```shell
pipx inject standardebooks pylint
```

Then make sure to call the `pylint` binary that `pipx` installed in the `standardebooks` venv, *not* any other globally-installed `pylint` binary:

```shell
cd /path/to/tools/repo
$HOME/.local/pipx/venvs/standardebooks/bin/pylint se
```

# Help wanted

We need volunteers to take the lead on the following goals:

- Writing installation instructions for Bash and ZSH completions for MacOS.

# Tool descriptions

-	### `se british2american`

	Try to convert British quote style to American quote style in DIRECTORY/src/epub/text/.

	Quotes must already be typogrified using the `se typogrify` tool.

	This script isn’t perfect; proofreading is required, especially near closing quotes near to em-dashes.

-	### `se build`

	Build an ebook from a Standard Ebook source directory.

-	### `se build-images`

	Build ebook cover and titlepage images in a Standard Ebook source directory and place the output in DIRECTORY/src/epub/images/.

-	### `se clean`

	Prettify and canonicalize individual XHTML, SVG, or CSS files, or all XHTML, SVG, or CSS files in a source directory. Note that this only prettifies the source code; it doesn’t perform typography changes.

-	### `se compare-versions`

	Use Firefox to render and compare XHTML files in an ebook repository. Run on a dirty repository to visually compare the repository’s dirty state with its clean state.

-	### `se create-draft`

	Create a skeleton of a new Standard Ebook.

-	### `se dec2roman`

	Convert a decimal number to a Roman numeral.

-	### `se extract-ebook`

	Extract an EPUB, MOBI, or AZW3 ebook into ./FILENAME.extracted/ or a target directory.

-	### `se find-mismatched-diacritics`

	Find words with mismatched diacritics in Standard Ebook source directories. For example, `cafe` in one file and `café` in another.

-	### `se help`

	List available SE commands.

-	### `se hyphenate`

	Insert soft hyphens at syllable breaks in an XHTML file.

-	### `se interactive-sr`

	Use Vim to perform an interactive search and replace on a list of files. Use y/n/a to confirm (y) or reject (n) a replacement, or to replace (a)ll.

-	### `se lint`

	Check for various Standard Ebooks style errors.

-	### `se make-url-safe`

	Make a string URL-safe.

-	### `se modernize-spelling`

	Modernize spelling of some archaic words, and replace words that may be archaically compounded with a dash to a more modern spelling. For example, replace `ash-tray` with `ashtray`.

-	### `se prepare-release`

	Calculate work word count, insert release date if not yet set, and update modified date and revision number.

-	### `se print-manifest-and-spine`

	Print `<manifest>` and `<spine>` tags to standard output for the given Standard Ebooks source directory, for use in that directory’s content.opf.

-	### `se print-toc`

	Build a table of contents for an SE source directory and print to stdout.

-	### `se recompose-epub`

	Recompose a Standard Ebooks source directory into a single HTML5 file, and print to standard output.

-	### `se renumber-endnotes`

	Renumber all endnotes and noterefs sequentially from the beginning.

-	### `se reorder-endnotes`

	Increment the specified endnote and all following endnotes by 1.

-	### `se roman2dec`

	Convert a Roman numeral to a decimal number.

-	### `se semanticate`

	Apply some scriptable semantics rules from the Standard Ebooks semantics manual to a Standard Ebook source directory.

-	### `se split-file`

	Split an XHTML file into many files at all instances of `<!--se:split-->`, and include a header template for each file.

-	### `se titlecase`

	Convert a string to titlecase.

-	### `se typogrify`

	Apply some scriptable typography rules from the Standard Ebooks typography manual to a Standard Ebook source directory.

-	### `se unicode-names`

	Display Unicode code points, descriptions, and links to more details for each character in a string. Useful for differentiating between different flavors of spaces, dashes, and invisible characters like word joiners.

-	### `se version`

	Print the version number and exit.

-	### `se word-count`

	Count the number of words in an HTML file and optionally categorize by length.


# What a Standard Ebooks source directory looks like

Many of these tools act on Standard Ebooks source directories. Such directories have a consistent minimal structure:

	.
	|-images/
	|--cover.jpg
	|--cover.source.jpg
	|--cover.svg
	|--titlepage.svg
	|-src/
	|--epub/
	|---css/
	|----core.css
	|----local.css
	|---images/
	|----cover.svg
	|----titlepage.svg
	|---text/
	|----colophon.xhtml
	|----imprint.xhtml
	|----titlepage.xhtml
	|----uncopyright.xhtml
	|---content.opf
	|---onix.xml
	|---toc.xhtml
	|--META-INF/
	|---container.xml
	|--mimetype
	|-LICENSE.md

`./images/` contains source images for the cover and titlepages, as well as ebook-specific source images. Source images should be in their maximum available resolution, then compressed and placed in `./src/epub/images/` for distribution.

`./src/epub/` contains the actual epub files.
