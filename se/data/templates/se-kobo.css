/*
Kobo forces a black border on all links, but doesn't change to white when dark mode is enabled!
This means that in dark mode, links are not underlined.
We can't override Kobo's style for `<a>`, but we *can* insert a `<span>` into each `<a>`, which we then style with the correct border color.
We have to use `currentColor` to account for the case of non-dark-mode, because Kobo doesn't support `@media` queries.
Kobo default styling is for dotted underlines, see <https://www.mobileread.com/forums/showpost.php?p=4468413&postcount=2>.
