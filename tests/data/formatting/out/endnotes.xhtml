					<p>Philip Stanhope, second Earl of Chesterfield, <abbr>ob.</abbr> 1713, <i xml:lang="la"><abbr>æt.</abbr> suæ</i> 80. We learn, from the memoir prefixed to his <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">Printed Correspondence</i>, that he fought three duels, disarming and wounding his first and second antagonists, and killing the third. The name of the unfortunate gentleman who fell on this occasion was Woolly. Lord Chesterfield, absconding, went to Breda, where he obtained the royal pardon from Charles <span epub:type="z3998:roman">II</span>. He acted a busy part in the eventful times in which he lived, and was remarkable for his steady adherence to the Stuarts. Lord Chesterfield’s letter to Charles <span epub:type="z3998:roman">II</span>, and the King’s answer granting the royal pardon, occur in the Correspondence published by General Sir John Murray, in 1829.</p>
					<blockquote>
						<p>“<abbr>Jan.</abbr> 17th, 1659. The Earl of Chesterfield and <abbr>Dr.</abbr> Woolly’s son of Hammersmith, had a quarrel about a mare of eighteen pounds price; the quarrel would not be reconciled, insomuch that a challenge passed between them. They fought a duel on the backside of <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Colby’s house at Kensington, where the Earl and he had several passes. The Earl wounded him in two places, and would fain have then ended, but the stubbornness and pride of heart of <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Woolly would not give over, and the next pass [he] was killed on the spot. The Earl fled to Chelsea, and there took water and escaped. The jury found it chance-medley.”</p>
