		<p>I selected the materials for a suit, with the assistance of <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Trabb’s judgment, and re-entered the parlor to be measured. For although <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Trabb had my measure already, and had previously been quite contented with it, he said apologetically that it “wouldn’t do under existing circumstances, sir⁠—wouldn’t do at all.” So, <abbr>Mr.</abbr> Trabb measured and calculated me in the parlor, as if I were an estate and he the finest species of surveyor, and gave himself such a world of trouble that I felt that no suit of clothes could possibly remunerate him for his pains.</p>
