			<p>As I was getting too big for <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Wopsle’s great-aunt’s room, my education under that preposterous female terminated. Not, however, until Biddy had imparted to me everything she knew, from the little catalogue of prices, to a comic song she had once bought for a halfpenny. Although the only coherent part of the latter piece of literature were the opening lines,</p>
			<blockquote epub:type="z3998:song">
				<p>
					<span>When I went to Lunnon town sirs,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Too rul loo rul</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Too rul loo rul</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Wasn’t I done very brown sirs?</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Too rul loo rul</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Too rul loo rul</span>
				</p>
			</blockquote>
			<p>—still, in my desire to be wiser, I got this composition by heart with the utmost gravity; nor do I recollect that I questioned its merit, except that I thought (as I still do) the amount of Too rul somewhat in excess of the poetry. In my hunger for information, I made proposals to <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Wopsle to bestow some intellectual crumbs upon me, with which he kindly complied. As it turned out, however, that he only wanted me for a dramatic lay-figure, to be contradicted and embraced and wept over and bullied and clutched and stabbed and knocked about in a variety of ways, I soon declined that course of instruction; though not until <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Wopsle in his poetic fury had severely mauled me.</p>
